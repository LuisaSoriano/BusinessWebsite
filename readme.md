# My Business Website
This website is being built with the purpose of helping me learn HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript.

This is the first website I build and I am putting it up on GitHub as part of my portfolio.

## My background
My background is on game development. I have designed and developed applied, serious and entertainment games.

My main interest is on XR technologies. At the moment I only have experience developing VR games.

## Programming Languages
The programming languages I know at the moment are: C#, GML, Java and Python.

The programming languages I am currently learning are: CSS, C and JavaScript.

## Why am I learning Web Development?
I have a bootcamp to attend on August called Create Camp, in Wellington. I have read some blog posts of people who previously attended Create Camp and they recommended to have web development experience and specially to know how to program JavaScript. Since I don't have any experience on this, I decided to start this project in order to upskill myself.

I am looking forward to use the skills in real world problems.
